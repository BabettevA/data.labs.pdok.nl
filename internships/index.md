title: Internships and Student Assignments
---

# Internships
At Kadaster/PDOK we have continuously assignments available for students at WO or HBO level in either technical, geospatial or business related studies. And both our offices in Zwolle and Apeldoorn provide workspaces. 

We have some specific assignments that can be found here: [Internships at Kadaster](https://www.werkenbijhetkadaster.nl/stages-en-afstuderen)
But in general we believe that setting up good assignments is already a collaboration between the student and the proposed supervisors, to make sure that the assignment fits the interest and potential of the student, and is also relevant from Kadaster/PDOK perspective. 

Here we provide some topics that have our explicit interest:

-  Enterprise Knowledge Graphs: The value of Knowledge Graphs on Kadaster/PDOK data.
-  Linking in Linked Data: Efficient and Effective ways to create links in datasets. 
-  GIS and Linked Data; How to foster the benefits from both worlds?
-  SOLID: the new concept for privacy data sharing; what is the impact?
-  BI and Linked Data: How BI toolings can be used to consume Linked Data.
-  Triple Stores: Provide state of the art research on triple stores, such as Amazone Neptune, Oracle Spatial and Graph, etc. 
-  Tourism: Provide a use case how the PDOK data can contribute for tourism.
-  LinkDale: Improving the Linked Data Learning Environment (software engineering skills are required)

If you are interested you can either ask more information by sending an e-mail to [Erwin Folmer](mailto:erwin.folmer@kadaster.nl) or directly sending your application (cv + motivation) in Dutch or English.
