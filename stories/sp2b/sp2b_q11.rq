# SPÂ²B11: Return (up to) 10 electronic edition URLs starting from the
# 51th publication, in lexicographical order.
#
# This query focuses on the combination of solution modifiers `order
# by', `limit', and `offset'.  In-memory engines have to read,
# process, and sort electronic editions prior to processing `limit'
# and `offset'.  In contrast, native engines might exploit indices to
# access only a fraction of all electronic editions and, as the result
# is limited to 10, reach constant runtimes.
