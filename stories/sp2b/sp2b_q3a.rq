# SPÂ²B3a: Select all articles with property `swrc:pages'.
#
# This query tests `filter' expressions with varying selectivity.
# According to Table I, the `filter' expression is not very selective
# (i.e. retains about 92.61% of all articles).  Data access through a
# secondary index is probably not very efficient.
